## Quick Reference

### Important Paths
- Xcode Project: `ios/McCallHome.xcodeproj`
- SwiftUI Views: `ios/McCallHome/Features/`
- Models: `ios/McCallHome/Core/Models/`
- Services: `ios/McCallHome/Core/Services/`
- Supabase Functions: `supabase/functions/`

### Key Files to Check
- `feature_list.json` - Feature completion status
- `.env` - Environment variables (never commit!)
- `ios/McCallHome/Core/Services/SupabaseClient.swift` - DB connection

### Supabase MCP Commands
- List tables: "List all tables in my Supabase database"
- Apply migration: "Apply this SQL migration to my Supabase project"
- Check data: "Show me the data in the [table] table"

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **Xcode build fails**: Check Supabase package resolved, clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- **Auth not working**: Verify SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in .env
- **Push notifications failing**: Check APNs key uploaded to Supabase
